[Nine Chronicles][9c] is a fully open-sourced online RPG without servers — like Bitcoin or BitTorrent,
the gamers and miners connect to each other to power a distributed game network.
Set in a vast fantasy world, it is governed by [its players][Discord], and supported by a complex economy
where supply and demand are the greatest currency.

Decentralized infrastructure has created new possibilities for online gaming, where communities
can become the actual owners of an online world. By fully open sourcing the repositories for
Nine Chronicles, players and developers alike can use any part of the game, from the beautiful
bespoke 2D assets to in-game logic and code.
